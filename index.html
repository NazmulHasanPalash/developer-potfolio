            <h3>When Food is love</h3>
            <p>Running a food blog while working a full time job can feel like a juggling act. Between baking, writing,
                photography, and all of the business and marketing tasks that go along with it, you can see why people
                do this as a full time job all on its own.

                <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>I am an avid foodie, is a much better statement. If you wish to make it sound more flamboyant, I'm an
                    avid
                    gourmand or just I'm a gourmand will do. Avid gourmand will be overkill, but if you're really
                    serious
                    about it, go ahead and use it.</p>
