            <h3>A Day in the Life of a Full Time Web Developer</h3>
            <p>If you’re considering a career in web development, you’ll no doubt want to know what’s it really like
                once you land that first role? To provide some real-life insight, we asked our in-house web developer
                Sam to talk us through his typical working day.

            <h3>When Food is love</h3>
            <p>Running a food blog while working a full time job can feel like a juggling act. Between baking, writing,
                photography, and all of the business and marketing tasks that go along with it, you can see why people
                do this as a full time job all on its own.
